Service Orchestration Engine (SOE) example for the IBM Voice Gateway (VGW) written in Node.js using the Restify REST framework.
For more information and other useful examples built with Python or Java please visit:

* [IBM WASdev Github](https://github.com/WASdev/sample.voice.gateway/tree/master/soe) - The IBM WASdev Github page

## What's NEW

### 2.2.0 - Current Release

* 2.2.0   : Added '/reporting' endpoint for Voice Gateway event logging (CDR, Transcriptions, Conversation) using Apache CouchDB as database backend.

### 2.1.0

* 2.1.0   : Support for multiple Watson Conversation Workspaces (multi-tenant).
* 2.1.0-1 : Minor changes - Code refactoring.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Docker Deployment

Please read [Docker-README.md](doc/Docker-README.md) for details

## Installing from sources

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 8.9.x

Clone the repository onto your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rfrobisher/node-voicegateway-soe.git
```

Go to the ```node-voicegateway-soe``` directory and install the project dependencies with npm

```sh
cd node-voicegateway-soe
npm install
```

### Setting your Conversation Credentials

Rename the ```settings.dist.json``` file to ```settings.json```

```sh
mv settings.dist.json settings.json
```

Add your Watson Conversation credentials to ```settings.json``` file.

For a single Conversation Workspace you can define as a parameter a single tenant block, with the Conversation credentials as the example below:

```javascript
    "conversation": {
        "description": "Watson Conversation credentials",
        "parameters": [
            {
                "tenantName": "<YOUR_TENANT_NAME_DESCRIPTION>",
                "workspaceID": "<YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID>",
                "username": "<YOUR_CONVERSATION_USERNAME>",
                "password": "<YOUR_CONVERSATION_PASSWORD>"
            }
    }
```

Instead, if your Voice Gateway comunicate against more than one Conversation Workspace, you can set as many tenant blocks inside the parameter key as you want!

```javascript
    "conversation": {
        "description": "Watson Conversation credentials",
        "parameters": [
            {
                "tenantName": "<YOUR_TENANT_NAME_DESCRIPTION>",
                "workspaceID": "<YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID>",
                "username": "<YOUR_CONVERSATION_USERNAME>",
                "password": "<YOUR_CONVERSATION_PASSWORD>"
            },
            {
                "tenantName": "<YOUR_TENANT_NAME_DESCRIPTION>",
                "workspaceID": "<YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID>",
                "username": "<YOUR_CONVERSATION_USERNAME>",
                "password": "<YOUR_CONVERSATION_PASSWORD>"
            },
        ...
    }
```

### Reporting Endpoint Configuration

By default the Voice Gateway can generate CDR, Transcriptions, and Conversation records.

For more information about setting up the Voice Gateway reporting event generation, please check:

* [Reporting Configuration](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4U29/config.html#config-reporting) - IBM Voice Gateway Documentation

As the SOE sits in the middle of the Voice Gateway and Watson Conversation, it can log events of both sides and send it to a remote CouchDB / CloudantDB database for storage.

Setup your CouchDB / CloudantDB parameters in ```settings.json`` file:

```javascript
    "couchdb": {
        "description": "Apache CouchDB instance parameters",
        "parameters": {
            "instanceName" :"<YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME_DESCRIPTION>",
            "host": "<YOUR_COUCHDB_HOST_NAME_OR_IP>",
            "database" : "<YOUR_COUCHDB_DATABASE_NAME>",
            "protocol": "http",
            "port": "5984",
            "username": "<YOUR_COUCHDB_USERNAME>",
            "password": "<YOUR_COUCHDB_PASSWORD>"
        }
    },
```

* Note : The SOE won't create a local DB if you set the ```reporting``` variable to ```true``` and don't add the          remote database parameters in the ```settings.json``` file!

### Running the Server

In the ```node-voicegateway-soe``` directory, start the server by running

```sh
npm start
```

### Adjust the logger timezone

To change the logger timezone export TZ as your local environment variable

```sh
export TZ=<YOUR_TIMEZONE_GOES_HERE>
```
