## What's NEW

### 2.2.0 - Current Release

* 2.2.0   : Added '/reporting' endpoint for Voice Gateway event logging (CDR, Transcriptions, Conversation) using Apache CouchDB as database backend.

### 2.1.0

* 2.1.0   : Support for multiple Watson Conversation Workspaces (multi-tenant).
* 2.1.0-1 : Minor changes - Code refactoring.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Docker Deployment

Please read [Docker-README.md](doc/Docker-README.md) for details

## Installing from sources

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 8.9.x

Clone the repository onto your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rfrobisher/node-voicegateway-soe.git
```

Go to the ```node-voicegateway-soe``` directory and install the project dependencies with npm

```sh
cd node-voicegateway-soe
npm install
```

### Setting your configuration

Rename the ```settings.dist.json``` file to ```settings.json```

```sh
mv settings.dist.json settings.json
```

Add your Watson Conversation credentials to ```settings.json``` file

```javascript
 "conversation": {
        "description": "Watson Conversation credentials",
        "parameters": {
            "username": "YOUR_CONVERSATION_USERNAME",
            "password": "YOUR_CONVERSATION_PASSWORD"
        }
    }
```

Wait, what about the Watson Conversation Workspace ID?

The SOE will use the ```WORKSPACE-ID``` sent by the IBM Voice Gateway, which is set in the ```WATSON_CONVERSATION_WORKSPACEID``` environment variable, for more information see:

* [IBM Voice Gateway](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4U29/config.html) - The IBM Knowledge Center

### Running the Server

In the ```node-voicegateway-soe``` directory, start the server by running

```sh
npm start
```

### Adjust the logger timezone

To change the logger timezone export TZ as your local environment variable

```sh
export TZ=<YOUR_TIMEZONE_GOES_HERE>
```
